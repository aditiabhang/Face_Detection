# Face_Detection ðŸ¤–

Facial Detection is my first step towards Machine Learning. ðŸ¦¾ 
This project consists of a python script to detect faces in an image or (webcam live video - in progress) using *haar cascade*.

**'Facial detection using Haar Cascade'** is a Machine Learning approach, where the haar cascade function is trained with a set of input data. 
These input set of data are available on the OpenCV github repository [OpenCV Pre-Trained Dataset Repo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades) which contains ample of pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, full body, front face, etc.
